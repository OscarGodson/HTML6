Would this not utterly destroy search engines?

Search engines rely whole heartedly on differing tags to decide how important something is.

if I have the following:

<html>
<head>
<title>
  Boots sale!
</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>
Boots sale!
</h1>
<p>
We are currently having a sale on all boots!
</p>
<h2>
Buy Flower hair clips!
</h2>
<p>
  Our website sells all kid of accessories from flower hair clips to squeaky shoes!
</p>
<h2>
New Flower Hair Clips!
</h2>
<p>
We have introduced a new line of flower hair clips!  Check <a href="newclips.html">here</a> for more details!
</p>
</body>
</html>

What is this website about?  You might say its about flower hair clips since there are two titles and two paragraphs about
flower hair clips.  But the actual TITLE of the site is boots sale allong with the, more important, h1 tagged boots sale!


You might say this page is about boots sale since it seems to be pushing that the hardest

These are decisions that search engines have to make.  The standards for our tags allows search engines to see and view whats important on the page and whats not.

Consider this hand written code:

<html:html>
<html:head>
<html:title>
  Boots sale!
</html:title>
</html:head>
<html:body>
<updatesPageTitle1>
Boots sale!
</updatesPageTitle1>
<updatesPageTitlePara1>
We are currently having a sale on all boots!
</updatesPageTitlePara1>
<updatesPageTitle2>
Buy Flower hair clips!
</updatesPageTitle2>
<updatesPagePara2>
  Our website sells all kid of accessories from flower hair clips to squeaky shoes!
</updatesPagePara2>
<updatesPageTitle3>
New Flower Hair Clips!
</updatesPageTitle3>
<updatesPagePara3>
We have introduced a new line of flower hair clips!  Check <a href="newclips.html">here</a> for more details!
</updatesPagePara3>
</html:body>
</html:html>

Here I have used the tags as defined by you.  I've made up my own and they are very descriptive telling me what they are marking up without the use of comments! Perfect right?  Well we cannot expect the search engines to be able to tell exactly what every ones custom mark up is doing.  so baring that knowledge our search engine has decided that this page is about flower hair clips now because there is a little more content about flower hair clips.

But because the search engine doesn't know what these tags mean, you might say that because the markup is more descriptive use this as data to rank it.

But now the page is about "updatesPage" rather than "boots sale" or "flower hair clips"

See whats changed?

What the heck is going on here?!?!

Now what is this page about?  It looks like its unfinished we'll rank it really low.


Pages designed with a mark up language such as the one you have designed could / would cause some confusion with search engines and completely lower the average relevance of search engine result pages.  Knowing this, developers would use html5 in order to attempt to gain rank in SERPS.

In conclusion, html6 designed in this fashion would never take hold.  It is therefore a waste of time to continue to work on a mark up like this.

Prove me wrong, write a page with no css, or js using html6 markup and see if you can get to page 1 for a search term with at least 1,000,000 competing pages.
